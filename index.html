    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP is a revolutionary utility token designed to engage users in the cryptocurrency ecosystem while simplifying access to blockchain technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to transform the concept of “eating the dip” into a strategic tool for sustainable community growth and financial empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operating on the robust Vector Smart Chain (VSC), CHIP stands on a foundation of transparency, compliance, and continuous innovation. Whether you are new to crypto or a seasoned enthusiast, CHIP offers accessible applications like staking, NFT rewards, and community governance.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a forward-thinking developer mindset, every process—from security protocols to liquidity management—is designed to be resilient and adaptive. Our comprehensive white paper elaborates on every detail.

    <!-- Tokenomics Section -->
    <section id="tokenomics">
      <h2>CHIP Tokenomics</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Total Supply and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          CHIP’s total supply is <strong>500 million tokens</strong>, strategically allocated to build a robust ecosystem:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>60% Liquidity Pool (Locked):</strong> Ensures deep liquidity and market stability.</li>
          <li><strong>20% Treasury (AI-Managed &amp; Locked):</strong> Funds strategic initiatives, including our AI-driven systems.</li>
          <li><strong>9% Development Fund:</strong> Supports infrastructure, security audits, and continuous upgrades.</li>
          <li><strong>4% Community Outreach:</strong> Drives growth through rewards, airdrops, and engagement activities.</li>
          <li><strong>2% Creator’s Wallet (Locked for 3 Months):</strong> Aligns the project’s long-term vision with creator commitment.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transaction Tax Mechanics &amp; Deflationary Measures</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>6% transaction tax</strong> is applied to every trade, reinforcing a sustainable economic model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1% Burn:</strong> Permanently removes tokens from circulation to enhance scarcity.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Redistribution:</strong> Rewards current holders and promotes loyalty.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Liquidity Contribution:</strong> Fortifies market depth and trading conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Development Fund:</strong> Invests in ongoing innovation and ecosystem growth.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Treasury Fund:</strong> Supports community-governed projects and strategic initiatives.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Creator’s Wallet:</strong> Sustains the long-term vision and future development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, our deflationary model includes weekly burn synchronization tied to network activity. The proprietary <strong>Snack Attack AI</strong> and <strong>Chip Stacker</strong> systems automatically monitor and manage treasury operations, ensuring that buybacks and liquidity injections occur in a secure, community-governed manner.

      <h2>Community and Ecosystem Engagement</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP’s evolution is driven by a vibrant, active community. Engagement initiatives are designed to reward participation, encourage collaboration, and empower every holder with governance rights.

    <!-- Buyback & Burn Section -->
    <section id="burn">
      <h2>Buyback &amp; Burn Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP’s deflationary model is enforced by an automated buyback and burn strategy. For every 1,000 VSG burned in the ecosystem, 1 CHIP is also burned—coupling our token’s deflationary mechanics with network security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community-led votes determine treasury use, and our AI-driven systems (Snack Attack AI and Chip Stacker) ensure that funds are utilized dynamically—either to reduce supply directly or to bolster liquidity in times of volatility.
