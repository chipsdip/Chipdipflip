    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP is a revolutionary utility token designed to engage users in the cryptocurrency ecosystem while simplifying
        access to blockchain technology. Our mission is to transform the concept of "eating the dip" into a strategic
        tool for community growth and sustainability. Operating within the Vector Smart Chain (VSC) ecosystem, CHIP
        ensures a robust and compliant framework for seamless adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIP’s philosophy revolves around engagement, utility, and community empowerment. It prioritizes accessibility,
        catering to all levels of crypto users through practical applications such as staking, NFTs, and rewards, achieved
        via carefully designed tokenomics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CHIP team fosters a collaborative, growth-oriented mindset, focusing on innovation, resilience under secure
        and scalable frameworks, and transparency, ensuring every process is open and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIP’s compliance is managed through the Vector Smart Chain and its onboarding partners, including GemPad.
        These entities handle KYC, AML protocols, liquidity locks, and fundraising to guarantee a trustworthy ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> CHIP is not offered or viewed as a security, bond, or financial promise in any jurisdiction.
        It is solely intended as a utility token for community engagement and fun within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

    <!-- Tokenomics Section -->
    <section id="tokenomics">
      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Total Supply and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          The total supply of CHIP tokens is set at 500 million. Here's how the tokens are allocated to ensure a balanced
          ecosystem and sustainable growth:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>60% Liquidity Pool (Locked):</strong> Ensures deep liquidity and stable trading conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>20% Treasury (AI-Managed & Locked):</strong> Funds CEX listings, staking incentives, and treasury-backed governance proposals.</li>
          <li><strong>9% Development Fund:</strong> Supports infrastructure, security audits, and ecosystem upgrades.</li>
          <li><strong>4% Community Outreach:</strong> Fuels user engagement, gamification incentives, and airdrops.</li>
          <li><strong>2% Creator’s Wallet (Locked for 3 Months):</strong> Ensures long-term project sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transaction Tax Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
          CHIP implements a 6% transaction tax to foster a sustainable economic model. Each transaction automatically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1% Burn:</strong> Reduces total supply, increasing scarcity.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Redistribution:</strong> Rewards existing token holders, encouraging holding and participation.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Liquidity Pool Contribution:</strong> Enhances market depth and stability.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Development Fund:</strong> Supports ongoing ecosystem growth.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Treasury Fund:</strong> Strengthens CHIP’s governance-backed treasury.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Creator’s Wallet:</strong> Provides long-term project sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Deflationary Mechanisms and Sustainability</h3>
        <p>
          CHIP integrates carefully designed deflationary mechanisms that support long-term sustainability and value
          retention. Central to this strategy is the relationship between CHIP's burn mechanics and community-driven
          governance, ensuring a balanced approach to supply reduction and ecosystem vitality.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>VSG Sync Burn Mechanism:</strong> For every 1,000 VSG burned within the ecosystem, 1 CHIP token is burned, aligning CHIP's deflationary model with the activity and security mechanisms of the Vector Smart Chain (VSC).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Governance-Led Buybacks:</strong> CHIP holders vote on biannual buybacks, funded by the treasury allocation, allowing the community to decide between burning tokens or reinvesting in ecosystem growth.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CHIP’s community governance further distinguishes the token, with holders voting on key financial decisions
          regarding treasury-backed buybacks. These measures ensure that CHIP remains adaptable, relevant, and valuable for
          both current users and future adopters.

    <!-- Community Engagement Section -->
    <section id="community">

        and structured engagement strategies. These initiatives are designed to promote active participation, reward loyalty, 
        and strengthen the overall CHIP ecosystem.
      </p>

      <div class="card">

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Raid Requirements for Airdrops</h3>
        <p>
          To qualify for monthly airdrops, members must participate in organized raids. These are community-driven 
          marketing events aimed at promoting CHIP's visibility and adoption. Contributions are tracked via smart contracts 
          to ensure transparency and fairness.

    <!-- Buyback & Burn Section -->
    <section id="burn">
      <h2>Buyback & Burn Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP integrates a deflationary buyback and burn mechanism directly synchronized with the Vector Smart Chain (VSC). 
        This mechanism reduces the circulating supply, ensuring token scarcity and long-term value retention.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>VSG Sync Burn Mechanism:</strong> For every 1,000 VSG burned within the ecosystem, 1 CHIP token is burned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Governance-Led Buybacks:</strong> CHIP holders vote on biannual buybacks, determining whether funds are allocated to burns or reinvestment to enhance liquidity and market stability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These measures are designed to balance deflationary pressures with ecosystem vitality, fostering confidence and stability 
        within the CHIP economy. This approach empowers the community to play a direct role in shaping CHIP's future.
