      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP is a revolutionary utility token designed to engage users in the cryptocurrency ecosystem while simplifying
        access to blockchain technology. Our mission is to transform the concept of "eating the dip" into a strategic
        tool for community growth and sustainability. Operating within the Vector Smart Chain (VSC) ecosystem, CHIP
        ensures a robust and compliant framework for seamless adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIP’s philosophy revolves around engagement, utility, and community empowerment. It prioritizes accessibility,
        catering to all levels of crypto users through practical applications such as staking, NFTs, and rewards, achieved
        via carefully designed tokenomics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CHIP team fosters a collaborative, growth-oriented mindset, focusing on innovation, resilience under secure
        and scalable frameworks, and transparency, ensuring every process is open and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIP’s compliance is managed through the Vector Smart Chain and its onboarding partners, including GemPad.
        These entities handle KYC, AML protocols, liquidity locks, and fundraising to guarantee a trustworthy ecosystem.

    <!-- Tokenomics Section -->
    <section id="tokenomics">
      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Total Supply and Distribution</h3>
        <p>The total supply of CHIP tokens is set at 10 million. Here's how the tokens are allocated to ensure a balanced
          ecosystem and sustainable growth:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>60% Liquidity Pools: Maintains market stability and ensures sufficient liquidity in exchanges.</li>
          <li>15% Centralized Listings: Improves token accessibility on global platforms.</li>
          <li>10% Buyback & Burn: Gradually reduces the circulating supply, thereby increasing token value.</li>
          <li>9% Development Team: Funds ongoing development and operational costs.</li>
          <li>4% Community Building: Incentivizes growth through rewards, airdrops, and engagement activities.</li>
          <li>2% Creator’s Wallet: Locked for alignment with the project's long-term goals.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transaction Tax Mechanics</h3>
        <p>CHIP implements a 4% transaction tax to foster a sustainable economic model. Each transaction automatically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1% Burn:</strong> Reduces the overall token supply, increasing scarcity.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Redistribution:</strong> Rewards existing token holders, encouraging holding and participation.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Liquidity:</strong> Strengthens the liquidity pool, ensuring stable trading conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>1% Development:</strong> Funds ongoing expansion and innovation within the CHIP project.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Deflationary Mechanisms and Sustainability</h3>
        <p>
          CHIP integrates carefully designed deflationary mechanisms that support long-term sustainability and value
          retention. Central to this strategy is the relationship between CHIP's burn mechanics and community-driven
          governance, ensuring a balanced approach to supply reduction and ecosystem vitality.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Weekly Burn Synchronization with VSG:</strong> For every 1,000 VSG burned in the ecosystem, 1 CHIP
            is also burned, aligning CHIP's supply dynamics with the activity and security mechanisms of the Vector Smart
            Chain (VSC).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Buyback and Burn Wallet:</strong> Initially funded with 10% of the total CHIP supply, this wallet dynamically
            adjusts the market supply through burns or by enhancing liquidity and market stability via strategic VSG purchases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CHIP’s community governance further distinguishes the token, with holders voting on key financial decisions
          regarding buyback funds. These measures ensure that CHIP remains adaptable, relevant, and valuable for
          both current users and future adopters.

    <section id="community">
      <h2>Community Engagement</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP emphasizes community involvement through initiatives like monthly airdrops, participation incentives, and
        structured engagement strategies.
      </p>
      <div class="card">

            contributions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Raid Requirements for Airdrops</h3>
        <p>
          To qualify for monthly airdrops, members must participate in organized raids, which are community-driven
          marketing events promoting CHIP's visibility and adoption. Contributions are tracked via smart contracts to
          ensure transparency and fairness.

    <!-- Buyback & Burn Section -->
    <section id="burn">
      <h2>Buyback & Burn Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        CHIP integrates a deflationary buyback and burn mechanism linked directly to the Vector Smart Chain (VSC).
        This mechanism reduces circulating supply, ensuring token scarcity and value retention.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly Burn Synchronization:</strong> For every 1,000 VSG burned in the ecosystem, 1 CHIP is also
          burned, aligning supply dynamics with the VSC.</li>
        <li><strong>Buyback and Burn Wallet:</strong> Initially funded with 10% of the total CHIP supply, this wallet dynamically
          adjusts supply through semi-annual community votes to determine allocation for burns or liquidity enhancements.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Governance:</strong> CHIP holders participate in biannual voting to guide the use of funds,
          prioritizing liquidity growth or supply reduction as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These measures balance deflationary pressures and ecosystem vitality, fostering confidence and stability within the
        CHIP token economy.
